# Presentation on Vision transformers' architecture

A vision transformer (ViT) is a transformer designed for computer vision. 
A ViT breaks down an input image into a series of patches (rather than breaking up text into tokens), serialises each patch into a vector, and maps it to a smaller dimension with a single matrix multiplication. These vector embeddings are then processed by a transformer encoder as if they were token embeddings
