\frametitle{Transformer}
\textbf{Self-attention-based architectures}, in particular Transformers, have become the model of choice in natural language processing.
\vspace{0.5cm}

The dominant approach is to pre-train on a \textbf{large text corpus and then fine-tune on a smaller task-specific dataset}.

\frametitle{What computer vision?}
In computer vision, however, \textbf{convolutional architectures remain dominant}.
Multiple works try combining \textbf{CNN-like architectures with self-attention}, while theoretically efficient, have not yet been scaled effectively on modern hardware accelerators due to the use of specialized attention patterns.

\frametitle{What computer vision?}
With Vision transformer the end goal is to \textbf{apply a standard Transformer directly to images}, with the fewest possible modifications
