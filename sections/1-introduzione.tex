\frametitle{Transformer}
\textbf{Self-attention-based architectures}, in particular Transformers, have become the model of choice in natural language processing.
\vspace{0.5cm}

The dominant approach is to pre-train on a \textbf{huge amount of samples and then fine-tune on a smaller task-specific datasets}.

\frametitle{What about computer vision?}
In computer vision before, however, \textbf{convolutional architectures remained dominant} before ViT.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiple works try combining \textbf{CNN-like architectures with self-attention}
    \item Needed scalability with modern HW.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{What computer vision?}
With Vision transformer the end goal is to \textbf{apply a standard Transformer architectures directly to images}, with the fewest possible modifications
